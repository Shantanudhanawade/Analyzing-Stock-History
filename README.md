HERE we have used and yfinance API/library from yahoo through IBM learning/cloud and this entire project is done on watson.ai studio .
IBM Watson Studio is an IDE to build, run and manage AI models. It is available as SaaS or for self-hosting as part of IBM Cloud Pak for Data.
In the following project i have also done web scrapping for the stock websites besides using library data because not all data is always availabel on API so would be web scrapping to obtain financial data.

A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares."
